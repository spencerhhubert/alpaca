# Where to start
If you're interested in working on the Alpaca project but you don't know where to start, I've setup some suggested study material.

However, I encourage you to just dive in as soon as you have a rough idea where to go. Don't spend too long in the study stage.

## I don't know Python
- Get a quick intro to Python. You don’t need to be an expert, just spend a day or two. Here are some options:
  - [LearnXinYMinutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
    - My favorite website for language TLDRs
    - If you’re already skilled in some other language, if you already know how to program, this is what I recommend
  - [IntroToPython.org](http://introtopython.org/)
    - More in depth
  - [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
    - Free book
    - Good if you have no programming experience
- Learn the Git basics
    - We'll rely heavily on Git in this project. This will be primarily how we assign tasks and generally collaborate. This is a great (and critical) skill for a career in programming as well.
    - What do/know
        - Make a GitHub account
        - Figure out how to clone repositories
        - Figure out how to push and pull from repositories on your local computer
        - VS Code has some GitHub integration that makes this easy

## I don’t know what a neural network is
- [Andrej Karpathy YouTube Lectures Zero To Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
  - This is personally my favorite introduction to neural networks. Andrej goes through developing neural networks from scratch from the math or the papers in such a way that the code is quite similar to PyTorch, which is where the same concepts are made fast enough to be practical.
- [Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
  - The Fast.ai course has a good set of lectures of Python Jupyter notebooks for learning what neural networks are.
  - Although Fast.ai is a different library than PyTorch, the overall principles are the same.

## I have some experience
- Become familiar with the style of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)’s API
    - They have some [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- Learn how transformers work
    - This is the basis of LLaMA
    - In-depth but good: [Transformers from Scratch](https://e2eml.school/transformers.html)
    - [More Karpathy lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)
    - Attention
